Hey, I'm Deepak Jangra! ðŸ‘‹

In 2017, I started my journey as a software engineer, diving deep into coding and problem-solving. Now, I'm stepping into entrepreneurship, building in public, and sharing my experiences along the way.

Over the years, I've worked with cutting-edge technologies, contributed to impactful projects, and embraced the thrill of creating something from scratch.

Excited for what's aheadâ€”let's build together! ðŸš€
